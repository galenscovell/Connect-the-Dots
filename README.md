# Connect-the-Dots

<blockquote>JavaScript web app written for a timed coding challenge. The challenge was given as a pre-screen for a company I applied to several months ago. I was accepted for a phone screen and eventually to an onsite interview, but had already accepted another offer elsewhere. :)</blockquote>

* Quick, fun connect-the-dots app utilizing canvas animations and a rudimentary convex hull algorithm ensuring that the lines connecting dots never cross.
* You can access the app here: [http://galenscovell.github.io/Connect-the-Dots/]
